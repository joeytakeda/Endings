OUTLINE:

 - Intro: Early Days (already drafted)

 - Project Endings: personnel, projects, work done, and funding

 - The Principles
 
 - The implementation, in our actual projects; elucidate the sections of the Principles document with real-world examples and discussion:
 
    - Data (standards, formats, VCS)

    - Products (draw on our previous work on HTML5/JS/CSS, and our relentless validation stuff; also discuss the work on Mariage that tested products using the Heritrage harvester)
    
    - Processing (draw on ???)
    
    - Documentation 
    
    - Release Management (we now have enough numbered and archived releases for this to be easy to illustrate)

 - The Lingering Problem: Search
 
    - Our intermediate phase: eXist apps with entirely static content save for search
    
    - Experimentation with Google and Solr (draw on Tokyo presentation for this and below)
    
    - Existing offline searches: the single-massive-index approach, no use at scale
    
    - Our little brainwave: you only need the bits of the index that server your actual search.
    
    - How staticSearch works
    
 - Now it's built, how do we archive it? Negotiating with the Library.
    
 - Conclusion:
 
    - We did it
    - You can do it
    - You should do it
    - You'll regret it if you don't do it
