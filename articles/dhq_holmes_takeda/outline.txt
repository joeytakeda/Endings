OUTLINE:

 - Intro: Early Days (already drafted)

 - Project Endings: personnel, projects, work done, and funding

 - The Principles
 
 - The implementation, in our actual projects; elucidate the sections of the Principles document with real-world examples and discussion:
 
    - Data (standards, formats, VCS)

    - Products (draw on our previous work on HTML5/JS/CSS, and our relentless validation stuff; also discuss the work on Mariage that tested products using the Heritrage harvester)
    
    - Processing (draw on ???)
    
    - Documentation 
    
    - Release Management (we now have enough numbered and archived releases for this to be easy to illustrate)
